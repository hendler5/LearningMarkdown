##Getting Started
When starting a technical writing project, you need to answer a few basic questions up front, write an outline, and then fill in the details.  
The following sections further explore each of these topics.

###Answering the Big Questions First
Answering the following questions will guide you to producing effective documentation:

* Who is the target audience?
 * New user of an application
 * Experienced software developer
 * Baby Boomer or Millennial
* What type of information needs to be conveyed?
 * Introductory or detailed
 * Conceptual or Task-based / instructional
 * Technical or non-technical
* What medium best suits the type of information?
 * Book
 * Online help
 * Video
* Where will the information reside?
 * Internal or external
 * Secured or publicly accessible

###Creating an Outline
After you have answered the big questions and have an idea of the documentation you need to write, create an outline. Outlines are important because they provide a map to your documentation's final intent. 

After you have created an outline, have the product owner review it to ensure you are headed in the right direction. You don't want to start writing without some sort of review and approval process, which can be as informal as an email or a brief meeting.

###Filling in the Details
After the outline is approved, the writing process begins. A big part of the writing process is researching what you plan to write about. Having a solid understanding of the topic is crucial for producing effective documentation. Often, the research takes far longer than the actual writing does.
