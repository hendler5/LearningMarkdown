## Getting Started

When starting a technical writing project, the first thing you need to do is answer a few basic questions, and then write an outline. Afterwards, you fill in the details of the outline and begin the writing process. The following sections further explore each of these topics.

### Answering the Basic Questions

Answering the following questions will guide you to producing effective documentation:

* Who is the target audience?

  * New user of an application
  * Experienced software developer
  * Baby Boomer or Millennial
  
* What type of information needs to be conveyed?

  * Introductory or detailed
  * Conceptual or Task-based / instructional
  * Technical or non-technical
  
* What medium best suits the type of information?

  * Book
  * Online help
  * Video
  
* Where will the information reside?

  * Internal or external
  * Secured or publicly accessible

### Creating an Outline

After you have answered the big questions and have an idea of the documentation you need to write, create an outline. Outlines are important because they provide a map to your documentation's final intent. 

After you have created an outline, have the product owner review it to ensure you are headed in the right direction. You don't want to start writing without some sort of review and approval process, which can be as informal as an email or a brief meeting.

### Filling in the Details

After the outline is approved, the writing process begins. A big part of the writing process is researching what you plan to write about. Having a solid understanding of the topic is crucial for producing effective documentation. Often, the research takes far longer than the actual writing does.
